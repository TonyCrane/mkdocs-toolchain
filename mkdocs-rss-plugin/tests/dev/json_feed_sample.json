We have built something that \na core group of users love, but we have concluded that the market \nopportunity isn’t big enough to warrant continued investment in \nthis way. It’s easy for startups to ignore this reality, but often \nmaking the tough call earlier is better for everyone involved. The \nbiggest opportunity cost is time working on newer, bigger and \nbetter things that have the ability to reach many millions of \npeople. I am personally excited to continue building new things, \nthough only time will tell what that might be. We live in an \nexciting time where artificial intelligence is changing just about \neverything we touch, and the opportunities for new ideas seem \nlimitless. </p>\n\n<p>I am particularly proud of all the work our small team of 8 has \naccomplished. For instance, our app was recently named the \neveryday essential app of the year by the Google Play Store. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Winning an award on Android is a little like winning the Canadian Football League title. Artifact had great potential — no surprise given its pedigree: Systrom and Mike Krieger are hall of famers for Instagram — but never became a top-tier iOS app.</p>\n\n<p>When it debuted a year ago, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/01/31/artifact\">I called it a disappointment</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s just <em>ads ads ads</em>, interrupting seemingly every single \narticle, every couple of paragraphs. This same “<em>man, I miss ad \nblockers</em>” feeling strikes me when I use Apple News too, but Apple \nNews articles have way fewer ads, and better ads, than what I’m \nseeing so far in articles I read in Artifact. “Like Apple News but \nworse” is not a good elevator pitch. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Instagram was an instant sensation because it was obviously such a \npremium experience. Great photos, with cool filters (which filters \nwere necessary to make phone camera pictures look great a decade \nago), a simple social concept, all wrapped in a great app. \nArtifact does feel like a nice app, but the reading experience, at \nleast today, is anything but premium. It feels cheap. And the \nsocial aspect isn’t there yet. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I stuck with it all year, but have used it less than ever in recent months. In the first half of 2023, Artifact’s suggestions were improving steadily for me, but in recent months the quality of the suggestions dropped off a cliff for me. Lots of clickbait.</p>\n\n<p>They added the social component, with the ability to post articles and add comments, but those features didn’t make the overall product any better. And while the core reading experience improved, it never improved to the point where it was as good as reading in Safari. Their refusal to focus on providing first and foremost a premium <em>reading</em> experience is exemplified by their own blog post announcing their shutdown. It looks <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/01/shutting-down-artifact-medium-box-mac.png\">like this on MacOS</a>, and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/01/shutting-down-artifact-medium-box-iphone.png\">this on iOS</a>.

Mr. Gore was elected at Apple’s board meeting today. </p>\n\n<p>“Al brings an incredible wealth of knowledge and wisdom to Apple \nfrom having helped run the largest organization in the world — the United States government — as a Congressman, Senator and our \n45th Vice President. Al is also an avid Mac user and does his own \nvideo editing in Final Cut Pro,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “Al \nis going to be a terrific Director and we’re excited and honored \nthat he has chosen Apple as his first private sector board to \nserve on.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I love that the second sentence from Jobs was about how Gore is a Mac enthusiast who uses Final Cut Pro. Compare and contrast with today’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/wanda-austin-to-join-apples-board-of-directors/\">utterly milquetoast statements from Tim Cook and chairman Arthur Levinson</a> about new board member Wanda Austin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Wanda has spent decades advancing technology on behalf of \nhumanity, and we’re thrilled to welcome her to Apple’s board of \ndirectors,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “She’s an extraordinary \nleader, and her invaluable experience and expertise will support \nour mission of leaving the world better than we found it.” </p>\n\n<p>“Wanda has long been a leader in unleashing the potential of \ncutting-edge technology,” said Arthur Levinson, the chair of \nApple’s board of directors. “She brings incredible insights and \nexperience to our board, and she will play an important role in \nhelping Apple continue enriching users’ lives around the world.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In 2003 there was one person in the world who could be described as a former vice president of the United States and avid Mac user. (That’s still true today, and that person remains Al Gore.) Cook’s and Levinson’s descriptions of Austin could apply to just about any technology company executive in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Gore’s statement from 2003:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Steve and his team have done an incredible job in making Apple \nonce again the very best in the world,” said former Vice President \nAl Gore. “I have been particularly impressed with the new Mac OS X \noperating system and the company’s commitment to the open source \nmovement. And I am especially looking forward to working with and \nlearning from the great board members who have guided this \nlegendary company’s inspiring resurgence.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In 2003, Mac OS X was the most important product for the future of the company, and the open source movement was one of the major stories of the moment.</p>\n\n<p>Austin’s statement today:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Like Apple, I’ve always believed in the power of innovation to \nimprove lives, support human potential, and shape a better \nfuture,” said Dr. Austin. “I’m honored to join Apple’s board of \ndirectors, and I look forward to being part of a company that’s \nalways creating new ways to empower people all over the world.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>She could have said the exact same thing about joining the board of <em>any</em> tech company in the world today. If she serves for 20 years, like Gore did (which is unlikely, given that she’s already 70 and Gore is stepping down because of a policy “directors generally may not stand for reelection after reaching age 75”<sup id=\"fnr2-2024-01-12\"><a href=\"#fn2-2024-01-12\">2</a></sup>), no one in the year 2044 is going to look back her statement above and think, <em>Yeah, that captures what was then the current moment for Apple.</em> Austin may well be a perfect candidate to serve on Apple’s board, but there’s nothing in today’s press release that indicates why.</p>\n\n<p>Gore was widely mocked in the run-up to the 2000 election for supposedly claiming to have “invented the internet”. But he never claimed any such thing. <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/internet-of-lies/\">From Snopes</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The claim that Gore was actually trying to take credit for the \n“invention” of the Internet was plainly just derisive political \nposturing that arose out of a close presidential campaign. If, for \nexample, Dwight Eisenhower had said in the mid-1960s that he, \nwhile president, “took the initiative in creating the Interstate \nHighway System,” he would not have been the subject of dozens and \ndozens of editorials lampooning him for claiming he “invented” the \nconcept of highways or implying that he personally went out and \ndug ditches across the country to help build the roadway. Everyone \nwould have understood that Eisenhower meant he was a driving force \nbehind the legislation that created the highway system, and this \nwas the very same concept Al Gore was expressing about himself \nwith interview remarks about the Internet. [...] </p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://amsterdam.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0009/msg00311.html\">spirited defense of Gore’s statement</a> penned by Internet \npioneers Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf (the latter often referred to \nas the “father of the Internet”) in 2000 noted that “Al Gore was \nthe first political leader to recognize the importance of the \nInternet and to promote and support its development” and that “No \nother elected official, to our knowledge, has made a greater \ncontribution [to the Internet] over a longer period of time.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not a bad endorsement.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2024-01-12\">\n<p>No mention of Gore’s appointment to the board in <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2003/03/\" title=\"Daring Fireball Archive: March 2003\">my archive for March 2003</a>, but that preceded the existence of the <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/\">Linked List</a> (my short-form link entries).

Back in the 90s, there \nwere several really good Tetris games for the Mac. Anyone remember \n<a href=\"https://harddrop.com/wiki/Wesleyan_Tetris\">Wesleyan Tetris</a>? It was a goofy version in which the \ndeveloper, Randall Cook, would rudely critique your gameplay. </p>\n\n<p>If The Tetris Company wants to protect the name “Tetris”, fine, \nbut I think it sucks that there’s no good way to play the game on \na Mac today. Every computer should have a good version of Tetris. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not much has changed from 2018. There is an officially licensed game in the Mac App Store now: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tetris-beat/id1536485727\">Tetris Beat</a>. It’s part of Apple Arcade, so most of you can probably download it and play it. It’s not just plain Tetris, and whatever is that it wants to be, it sucks. It doesn’t even let you customize the controls. It occupies 2.3 GB on disk after installation. For Tetris! Jiminy. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/11/wirth-plea-for-lean-software\">Niklaus Wirth would be rolling over</a> in his (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/11/niklaus-wirth-rip\">fresh</a>) grave if you told him a Tetris game took 2.3 GB on disk and made the fans get loud on an Apple silicon MacBook Pro when you play it.</p>\n\n<p>The best options for just playing Tetris on a Mac are web games: <a href=\"https://tetr.io/\">Tetr.io</a> and <a href=\"https://jstris.jezevec10.com/\">Jstris</a>. (I presume both websites are hosted in countries outside the reach of litigious The Tetris Company.) Tetr.io offers “desktop” versions, but their Mac app is an Intel-only Electron app that instantly made the fans on my MacBook Pro veritably roar. It’s far better playing online in Safari, but Tetr.io is geared toward Tetris fanatics, not casual play. Jstris is simpler, but fundamentally exists as a platform for competitive online play. (Go to Play → Practice to just play single player.)</p>\n\n<p>What a sad state of affairs. A hearty <em>fuck you</em> to The Tetris Company for ruthlessly shutting down hobbyist clones while refusing to license a decent official just-plain-Tetris Mac app.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Hard to believe I didn’t come across this on my own, but it turns out The Tetris Company has <a href=\"https://tetris.com/play-tetris\">a decent simple Tetris game on their own website</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/03/28/tetris-mac\">daringfireball.net/linked/2018/03/28/tetris-mac</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Such a blunt rejection of the \nConstitution and the basic concept of American democracy is too \nmuch even for Trump to assert — publicly, at least — so his \nlawyers have proposed a theory. They say that he can’t be \ncriminally prosecuted unless he is first impeached and convicted \nby Congress. </p>\n\n<p>This argument is no less dangerous, as a hypothetical asked in \ncourt demonstrated in chilling terms. Judge Florence Pan asked \nTrump’s attorney, D. John Sauer, if “a president who ordered SEAL \nTeam 6 to assassinate a political rival” could be criminally \nprosecuted. Sauer tried to hem and haw his way through an answer \nbut ultimately stated that such a president couldn’t be prosecuted \nunless he was first impeached, convicted, and removed by Congress. </p>\n\n<p>“But if he weren’t, there would be no criminal prosecution, no \ncriminal liability for that?” Pan pressed. Sauer had no choice but \nto agree, because acknowledging any exceptions would have blown a \nhole in his argument. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The most forgiving take on this argument is that Trump’s legal team doesn’t mean it, and they’re merely stalling for time — throwing as much shit as possible up against the appeals court walls, hoping to delay his umpteen trials until after his possible reelection in a year. But Trump himself <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4400173-trump-immunity-golden-years-retirement/\">clearly means it</a>. (<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2024-01-15\">Barry Blitt’s cover illustration</a> for The New Yorker this week is sublime.)</p>\n\n<p>The best refutation of Trump’s argument that presidents are above the law, and accountable only to Congressional impeachment, <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@repraskin/post/C175OMORWpa\">comes from Representative Jamie Raskin</a>, who points to the glaring game theory hole in this absurd argument: if it were true, the president could order the assassination of any congressperson who threatened to impeach or convict him. As Raskin concluded, “This is the GOP 2024.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/01/trump-presidential-immunity-trial/677068/\">theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/01/trump-presidential…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

         "content_html" : "\n<p>Liam Proven, in a nice obituary in The Register:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Swiss computer scientist Professor Niklaus Wirth died on New \nYear’s Day, roughly six weeks before what would have been his 90th \nbirthday. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/\">Wirth</a> is justly celebrated as the creator of the Pascal \nprogramming language, but that was only one step in a series of \nimportant languages and research projects. Both <a href=\"https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=21655\">asteroid \n21655</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.techslang.com/definition/what-is-wirths-law/\">law of computer design</a> are named after \nhim. He won computer-science boffinry’s highest possible gong, the \nTuring Award, <a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/wirth_1025774.cfm\">in 1984</a>, and that page has some short \nEnglish-language clips from a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUgrS_KbSI8\">2018 interview</a>. [...]</p>\n\n<p>As described in C H Lindsey’s <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/234286.1057810\">History of ALGOL-68</a> [PDF], \nwhen the ALGOL-W proposal was rejected, Wirth resigned from the \ncommittee, contributing a strong <a href=\"https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/algol/algol_bulletin/A29/P32.HTM\">“Closing Word”</a> to the \nNovember 1968 <a href=\"https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/algol/algol_bulletin/\">Algol Bulletin 29</a>, containing gems such as: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I pulled out my copy of the draft report on ALGOL-68 and showed it \nto her. She fainted. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Instead, Wirth took his proposal, changed it to be somewhat \nless compatible with ALGOL, and released it in 1970 under the \nname Pascal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law\">Wirth’s Law</a> encapsulates Wirth’s philosophy: “The hope is that the progress in hardware will cure all software ills. However, a critical observer may observe that software manages to outgrow hardware in size and sluggishness.” Or, as he rephrased it in his <a href=\"http://www.projectoberon.net/wirth/ProjectOberon/PO.System.pdf\">paper describing Project Oberon</a>: “In spite of great leaps forward, hardware is becoming faster more slowly than software is becoming slower.” In many ways, this remains <em>the</em> fundamental problem of our entire industry. It’s a truism, and can only be mitigated. </p>\n\n<p>He endorsed simplicity and clarity, and his languages and system designs exemplified those ideals. Studying computer science in the early to mid-1990s, I was among the last to learn Pascal as a teaching language. After outgrowing BASIC, I had actually started learning Pascal my senior year in high school, in a class with just two other students — thanks, Mrs. Spatz — and it was that class that made me want to study computer science in college.</p>\n\n<p>And Pascal was to the original Macintosh what Objective-C was to Mac OS X — the language Apple established as the default for writing application software. Most of the apps that established the Macintosh as the platform for people with good taste in the 1980s and early 1990s were written in Pascal. <a href=\"http://www.think-pascal.org/\">THINK Pascal</a> was an IDE years — maybe over a decade — ahead of its time. (There were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal\">good Pascal systems on the PC side of the fence</a> too.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/04/niklaus_wirth_obituary/\">theregister.com/2024/01/04/niklaus_wirth_obituary/</a></strong></em></p>\n"

In doing so, the player, Blue \nScuti, broke world records for overall score, level achieved, and \ntotal numbers of lines in the 34-year-old game. Previously, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_KY_EwZEVA&amp;ref=404media.co\">only \nan AI had broken Tetris</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The feat took Blue Scuti about 38 minutes, as shown in a video he \nposted to his YouTube. As he nears the feat, Blue Scuti says “Oh I \nmissed it,” after misplacing a block. He recovers, then says “Oh \nmy God,” as it seems like he’ll be able to do it. “Please crash,” \nhe says as the blocks careen down the screen impossibly fast. He \ngets another line and the game freezes: “Oh my God! Yes! I’m going \nto pass out,” he says. “I can’t feel my hands.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/03/arts/tetris-beat-blue-scuti.html\">Sopan Deb’s story about Gibson for The New York Times</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ms. Cox bought her son a version of a Nintendo console called a \nRetroN, which used the same hardware as the original Nintendo \nconsole, from a pawnshop, as well as an old cathode-ray tube \ntelevision to help him get started. In a given week, Willis said, \nhe plays about 20 hours of Tetris. </p>\n\n<p>“I’m actually OK with it,” Ms. Cox, a high school math teacher, \nsaid. “He does other things outside of playing Tetris, so it \nreally wasn’t that terribly difficult to say OK. It was harder to \nfind an old CRT TV than it was to say, ‘Yeah, we can do this for a \nlittle bit.’” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Koebler’s story ends with a sad note: “Blue Scuti dedicated the game to his dad, Adam Gibson, who died in December.” My mom’s mother died when my mom was just 16, so I’m familiar, second-hand, with how devastating such a loss is. Young Gibson seems utterly delightful — a gracious champion — so we’d all be rooting for him anyway, but this adds a note of poignancy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommended viewing:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuJ5UuknsHU\">This 17-minute video from aGameScout</a> is a wonderful, fun explanation of Gibson’s feat — it explains why NES Tetris was, for decades, thought to end at level 29; the new advanced controller techniques that allow elite players to blow past level 29; and suggests future accomplishments that remain unachieved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/13-year-old-becomes-first-person-to-ever-beat-tetris/\">404media.co/13-year-old-becomes-first-person-to-ever-beat…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Employees \nwere recently told by leadership that budgets would be lowered \nthis year, said one of the people, who requested anonymity to \nspeak without the company’s permission. </p>\n\n<p>The cuts, which numbered 10 people, come ahead of the \nfive-year-old startup shipping its first device: a $699, \nscreenless, AI-powered pin that is pitched as a smartphone \nreplacement. </p>\n\n<p>In a text message, Bongiorno told me that the cuts were “not \ncommunicated as a layoff” to those who were impacted, despite \nsources telling me that they were — both verbally and in writing. \n“It goes without saying that, like every company, we have a \nresponsibility to remain prudent and proactive, ensuring we have \nthe right roles, right people, and the right structure at every \njuncture,” she said. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Layoffs are never good — and layoffs before shipping the company’s first product are a particularly bad look — but 10/250 employees really does sound more like belt-tightening.

The \ncomments Monday from the National Transportation Safety Board came \nshortly after Alaska and United Airlines reported separately that \nthey found loose parts in the panels — or door plugs — of some \nother Boeing 737 Max 9 jets. </p>\n\n<p>“Since we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found \ninstances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door \nplug — for example, bolts that needed additional tightening,” \nChicago-based United said. </p>\n\n<p>Alaska said that as it began examining its Max 9s, “Initial \nreports from our technicians indicate some loose hardware was \nvisible on some aircraft.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This tidbit seems nutty to me:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The jet involved in Friday’s blowout is brand-new, having been put \nin service in November. After a cabin-pressurization system \nwarning light came on during three flights, the airline stopped \nflying it over the Pacific to Hawaii. Some aviation experts \nquestioned why Alaska continued using the plane on overland routes \nuntil it figured out what was causing the pressurization warnings. </p>\n\n<p>Homendy said Monday, however, that NTSB has seen no evidence to \nlink the warnings with the blowout of the door plug. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There may be no evidence yet, but what are the odds that a door plug that blew off a brand-new jet mid-flight — in a fleet of planes they’ve now discovered have loose bolts holding those doors in place — wasn’t to blame for the cabin-pressurization warnings? And, even if it’s true that the pressurization warnings were unrelated to last week’s incident, that’s even <em>worse</em> for Boeing — that would mean they have a problem with these door plugs <em>and</em> an as-yet undetermined other problem. I’m surprised that Boeing’s stock is only down ~8 percent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/alaska-and-untied-airlines-report-loose-parts-in-boeing-max-9-door-panels\">pbs.org/newshour/nation/alaska-and-untied-airlines-report…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

But we don’t roll over that easy, so the team worked \nthrough the weekend to prepare a new build to appease the App \nStore’s bullying bureaucrats, and I think you’re going to like \nwhat we came up with. </p>\n\n<p>See, Apple’s stated reason for rejecting the HEY Calendar app is \nonce again that “it doesn’t do anything when you download it”. In \nother words, it features a login screen, and requires you to have \nan existing account with <a href=\"https://www.hey.com/\">our HEY email service</a> in order \nto use it. It’s the textbook definition of a free companion app, \nwhich Apple specifically <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business\">exempts from having to use in-app \npayments</a>. They even cite Email Services(!!) as an example \nin 3.1.3(f): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em><strong>3.1.3(f) Free Stand-alone Apps:</strong> Free apps acting as a \nstand-alone companion to a paid web based tool (eg. VOIP, Cloud \nStorage, Email Services, Web Hosting) do not need to use \nin-app purchase, provided there is no purchasing inside the app, \nor calls to action for purchase outside of the app.</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems bonkers to me that after <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/16/hey-iap-app-store-dispute\">all the bad publicity that befell Apple in June 2020</a> over Apple’s rejection of the Hey email app, they’d veto a Hey companion app — which requires the exact same type of account as Hey email — for the exact same reasons. They should have just let it through, for the risk of bad publicity alone.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s just a taste from my own coverage of the Hey email app rejection back in June 2020:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/17/dithering-hey-apple\">Dithering: ‘Hey Apple, Cut It Out’</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/17/embracing-apples-cut\">On Avoiding or Embracing Apple’s In-App Purchase Cut</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/19/schiller-panzer-hey\">Phil Schiller Talks to Matthew Panzarino on Hey’s App Store Rejection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/19/swisher-app-store-hey\">Kara Swisher: ‘Is It Finally Hammer Time for Apple and Its App Store?’</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/20/siracusa-app-store\">Siracusa on the App Store: ‘Apple Needs to Decide if It Wants to Be “Right” or if It Wants to Be Happy’</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/22/apple-hey-path-forward\">Apple, Hey, and the Path Forward</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/22/patel-apple-hey\">Nilay Patel’s Summary of the Apple/Hey Drama</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t want people writing articles like those (or this very one) this week. They want people writing articles about Vision Pro.</p>\n\n<p>More crucially, regulators and legislators around the world are looking to wield antitrust powers against Apple, and all of them are primarily looking at the App Store. The stakes for Apple are much higher today than they were in 2020. The last thing Apple wants is a news narrative along the lines of “<em>More Bullshit From Apple Trying to Squeeze Developers Into Giving Them a Cut of Revenue When the Developers Simply Want to Sell Subscriptions Directly to Customers Over the Web</em>”. But by rejecting Hey Calendar, they seem to be <em>inviting</em> such a narrative.</p>\n\n<p>I just don’t get it. Apple has nothing to gain by this — *nothing, not a cent — but a lot to lose.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update, one day later:</strong> <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/apple-approves-the-hey-calendar-c76ebd9c\">Apple approved the Hey Calendar app</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

In most countries, people can just buy corrective glasses and contacts lenses without a prescription, but the U.S. — ostensibly the land of freedom — requires a doctor’s prescription.

What app will online buyers use to scan their faces for sizing? How much will extra Light Seals (for additional users) cost?</p>\n\n<p>And how much will the storage tiers above 256 GB cost?

To that end, \nhe’s jumping into hardware and launching the Typo Keyboard for the \niPhone 5 and 5S. The Bluetooth case turns an Apple handset into a \nmakeshift BlackBerry Q10, complete with backlit, sculpted keys \nthat cover up the iPhone’s home button (there’s a small substitute \nkey); we hope you don’t need multitasking, folks. The Typo \nKeyboard will make its formal debut at CES in early January, and \nit should ship that month for $99. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Typo keyboard was doomed in more ways than one: it used unreliable battery-draining Bluetooth, not a wired connection; iOS didn’t have good hardware keyboard support at the time; and, as Fingas alludes in his description above, the Typo keyboard’s design covered the iPhone’s home button. That was pretty much a dealbreaker for the iPhone 5S, which introduced Touch ID.</p>\n\n<p>Even worse, the shell of the company that was once the mighty BlackBerry <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/1/8696991/blackberry-typo-keyboard-lawsuit-settlement\">sued Typo for patent infringement</a>, won, and eventually <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/mobile/seacrest-out-blackberry-kills-his-typo-iphone-keyboard-n367736\">drove Typo out of business</a>.

One of the creators of the project is Michael “MrMobile” Fisher, who, of course, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2n2ftM-MwI\">created a YouTube video for the project</a>.

Clicks is even a great name. There’s no Bluetooth involved — it connects via Lightning or USB-C, just like any hardware keyboard can via a cable. If you’ve never connected a hardware keyboard to an iPhone before, you might be surprised how many keyboard shortcuts there are (Command-Space for Spotlight, Space and Shift-Space for paging down and up in Safari, Command-H to go to the Home screen, and more.)</p>\n\n<p>You’ll never guess which color I pre-ordered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.clicks.tech/\">clicks.tech/</a></strong></em></p>\n"

The counts for photos and videos weren’t the problem — the problem was the “2 Items”. <em>What were they?</em></p>\n\n<p>Caleb Hailey had the same problem, and posted a super-simple solution to Mastodon: a custom smart album for Photos for Mac with a dozen or so criteria like this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Filename does not include “.jpeg”</li>\n<li>Filename does not include “.png”</li>\n<li>Filename does not include “.heic”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and so forth. A few minutes of busy work and I found my culprits: two AAC audio files that were each just a few seconds long, and seemingly empty. I have no idea how or when they got into my Photos library but I’m delighted to have them gone.</p>\n\n<p>Worth pointing out: You don’t need to build up a list of every single filename extension that’s an image or video that you <em>do</em> want to keep in Photos. Once I built up a list of excluded filename extensions that whittled the list of matching items to 32, I just went through the items visually. The two AAC files stuck out like sore thumbs.</p>\n\n<p>Also worth pointing out: You cannot create smart albums in Photos on iPadOS or iOS. Only MacOS. (Same thing goes for smart mailboxes in Apple Mail.) Apple still treats the iPad and iPhone as <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/07/safari-chrome-firebox-multiple-tab-selection\">baby computers</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2016/02/apples_app_problem\">A similar problem I had back in 2016</a>, in which I had five unnamed items in my Photos library that could not be synced to iCloud.

While we’ve \nknown the name and location of the button, the internal \ninformation that we’ve obtained does not detail what it will be \nused for. </p>\n\n<p>According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the Capture Button will be \nable to record video. In <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-17/apple-2024-plans-new-low-end-airpods-vision-pro-larger-iphone-16-oled-ipad-lq9jhed4\">this week’s Power On newsletter</a>, \nGurman says that the iPhone 16 models will include a “new \ndedicated button for taking video.” [...] </p>\n\n<p>The Capture button will be a capacitive button with haptic \nfeedback rather than a mechanical button, and it is expected to \ninclude a force sensor that can recognize pressure. The location \nof the button may make it easy to trigger, but if it is activated \nvia pressure, it could be that holding it down will launch into \nthe camera and allow video recording to start. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If this comes true — and I hope it does — the button might default to shooting video, but I’d bet the house it will be configurable, like this year’s Action button. When using an iPhone as a camera, the main thing I miss from dedicated cameras is a hardware shutter button. With dedicated cameras, the shutter button can be pressed halfway to set exposure and focus, and only captures on a full press. A force-sensitive Capture button could work similarly.</p>\n\n<p>You can set the iPhone 15 Pro’s Action button to act as a shutter button for the Camera app, but it’s in the wrong location on the frame of the phone. I don’t want to press a shutter button with my left thumb, I want to press it with my right index finger. (You can orient the Action button to be on the top right by holding the iPhone horizontally with camera at the bottom, but that feels awkward to me.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/iphone-16-capture-button-video/\">macrumors.com/2023/12/17/iphone-16-capture-button-video/</a></strong></em></p>\n"

         "content_html" : "\n<p>There’s a lot to catch up on since <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/beeper_mini_is_back\">last I wrote about Beeper</a>. Long story short, they’ve been playing — and no surprise, losing — the cat-and-mouse game with Apple. What I had been seeing during the week before Christmas is that Beeper Mini half-worked: messages from Beeper Mini on Android would go through to Messages on an Apple device, but from any Apple device, you could get one message through to an Android device running Beeper, but only one. After that, messages sent from an iMessage user on an Apple device to a user running Beeper Mini would silently fail. I’m guessing that behind the scenes, after that initial message from an actual Apple device to a Beeper client would go through, Apple would determine that the Beeper device was illegitimate and blacklist the device ID.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of details, half-working interop for a messaging service might as well be not working at all.</p>\n\n<p>So Beeper effectively threw in the towel. Or maybe better put, <a href=\"https://blog.beeper.com/p/f19d91cd-f15b-45fb-82ce-5b21034df615\">half threw in the towel on their half-working app</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Each time that Beeper Mini goes “down” or is made to be unreliable \ndue to interference by Apple, Beeper’s credibility takes a hit. \nIt’s unsustainable. As much as we want to fight for what we \nbelieve is a fantastic product that really should exist, the truth \nis that we can’t win a cat-and-mouse game with the largest company \non earth. </p>\n\n<p>With our latest software release, we believe we’ve created \nsomething that Apple can tolerate existing. We do not have any \ncurrent plans to respond if this solution is knocked offline. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Their current “solution” requires Beeper Mini users to either (a) own — or, I swear, rent — an old iPhone (6, 6S, 7, 8, or X), jailbreak that phone, install Beeper’s software on the old jailbroken iPhone, and then <em>leave that old jailbroken phone powered on and connected to Wi-Fi continuously</em>; (b) have Beeper Cloud — their desktop app — installed and running on a Mac; or (c) run <a href=\"https://github.com/beeper/mac-registration-provider/\">a command-line tool</a> to, on a weekly basis, regenerate a new iMessage registration code. Only with a jailbroken iPhone can you register your Android device’s phone number as an iMessage ID; if you’re using or borrowing a Mac to generate a registration key, Beeper Mini will only work using an Apple ID account, with an email address as your ID. <a href=\"https://blog.beeper.com/p/a28168bb-b204-41b0-b6ee-7305584a8075\">Beeper’s own explanation for this rigmarole</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here’s the backstory. When you sign in to iMessage on Beeper, we \nneed to send identification information called “registration data” \nfrom a real Mac computer. We have, up until now, used our own \nfleet of Mac servers to provide this. Unfortunately, this has \nproven to be an easy target for Apple because thousands of Beeper \nusers were using the same registration data. </p>\n\n<p>Beeper Cloud (Mac version) and old iPhones can now generate unique \nregistration data just for you. This 1:1 mapping of registration \ndata to individual user, in our testing, makes the connection very \nreliable. If you use Beeper Mini, you can use your Mac \nregistration data with it as well, and Beeper Mini will start to \nwork again. Beeper needs to periodically regenerate this data even \nafter you’ve connected, roughly once per week or month, so the Mac \nneeds to be switched on regularly. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These hoops will relegate Beeper Mini to relative obscurity, even if Apple takes no further action to counter it.</p>\n\n<h2>The iMessage Lounge</h2>\n\n<p>Any take on this entire saga that treats Apple’s stance or actions as controversial, in the least, (see below for more on that), is deeply misguided. I think the fundamental misunderstanding is over just what iMessage is. It’s being talked about as though iMessage is merely a format or protocol, and that Beeper reverse-engineering the protocol is akin to, say, reverse engineering a document file format. iMessage is much more than a protocol — it’s a <em>service</em>. It requires servers (both for delivering messages and for the exchange of encryption keys), bandwidth, content moderation for spammers, and more. Apple’s iMessage infrastructure handles billions of messages per day — trillions per year — with unlimited full-resolution image and video attachments. iMessage has also proven to be extremely fast and reliable. Beeper itself glosses over this, <a href=\"https://blog.beeper.com/p/f19d91cd-f15b-45fb-82ce-5b21034df615\">in one of their updates yesterday</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Q: <em>“But you guys are making money off Apple’s servers!”</em> </p>\n\n<p>A: We stopped charging for Beeper Mini on Dec 11, and Beeper Cloud \n   has always been free to use. Additionally, Beeper Mini users \n   chat with paying Apple customers on the other side of the \n   conversation! If Apple proposed some way for us to reimburse \n   them for the (minuscule) infrastructure costs of enabling \n   paying iPhone customers to text Android users, we’d be happy to \n   comply with that. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple has never revealed the costs of running iMessage, but I suspect there are very few companies in the world who would consider the cost “minuscule”, and Beeper is not one of those companies. (Also, Beeper Mini users can just as easily use iMessage to message other Beeper Mini users — there’s nothing in Beeper Mini that requires someone in each chat to be using an actual Apple device.)</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the analogy I’ve been thinking best applies. American Express operates <a href=\"https://www.thecenturionlounge.com/\">Centurion Lounges</a> at a few dozen airports around the world, exclusively for the use of their Platinum Card holders. Other premium credit cards offer similar access to other lounges. If you have an American Express Platinum Card, you just show up, show them your card and boarding pass, and you’re in. You get free Wi-Fi; free food (pretty good); free beverages (including a full-service bar); and comfortable seats, tables, and desks. They even have showers for travelers on extended trips. They’re great — and a cut above even most airlines’ own lounges for their premium frequent travelers. Centurion Lounge access is presented as a free benefit, but, of course, there’s no more such a thing as a free premium lounge as there is a free lunch: the cost of the lounges is baked into the annual fees Platinum Card holders pay.</p>\n\n<p>iMessage is like a Centurion Lounge. It’s a free premium messaging service, exclusively for the use of people who own iPhones, iPads, and Macs. SMS, in this analogy, is like waiting for your plane out in the public airport terminal: not as nice, the Wi-Fi is worse, there’s no free food or drinks, but it’s available to everyone.</p>\n\n<p>iMessage users in a group chat who are annoyed by Android-owning group members relegating the conversation to SMS are like a group of friends travelling together — some of whom have Amex Platinum Cards, some of whom don’t — who need to wait in the public terminal if the group wants to wait for their flight together.<sup id=\"fnr1-2023-12-28\"><a href=\"#fn1-2023-12-28\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Like any analogy, it’s not perfect. Centurion Lounges allow cardholders to pay $50 to bring guests. iMessage has no “guest access” — you either have an Apple device, and with it, access to iMessage, or you don’t get to use iMessage. But I think the analogy basically works. Centurion Lounges are a perk for Amex Platinum Card holders; iMessage is a perk for Apple device owners. (Now that Apple runs its own credit card, it’s not outlandish to think that they might eventually offer Apple Card holders access to premium airport lounges.)</p>\n\n<p>If Beeper were granting its users free access to Centurion Lounges, I’m not sure how anyone could defend it, because everyone can see how a premium airport lounge costs a lot of money to run: leasing the space, hiring staff, and all the free food and beverages. But that’s exactly what Beeper is doing with iMessage: granting free access to a premium perk intended solely for Apple’s device owners while <em>they’re using those Apple devices</em>.</p>\n\n<p>One might argue that if you own a Mac, you should be able to use Beeper Mini on your Android phone, because the Mac qualifies for iMessage. With Beeper’s latest update, you can even use your own Mac to generate the iMessage registration code Beeper now requires. But Centurion Lounges don’t allow cardholders entry if they don’t present their actual card. (Don’t leave home without it.) Amex sets the terms for access to its Centurion Lounges; Apple sets the terms for access to iMessage. And Apple’s terms are clear: iMessage’s only authorized client software is Apple Messages running on an Apple device.</p>\n\n<p>Beeper Mini presenting itself as Messages on a Mac to gain access to iMessage is  as dishonest as presenting a forged Amex Platinum Card to gain access to a Centurion Lounge. Centurion Lounges aren’t free and neither is iMessage. And in the same way you’d expect Amex to crack down on a service that granted non-cardholders access to their lounges, Apple has cracked down on Beeper.</p>\n\n<p>If you prefer another analogy, imagine if Apple (<em>finally</em>) released an electric car and offered free charging for its own vehicles at a network of charging stations — and Beeper found a way to allow <em>any</em> electric vehicle to charge, for free, at those stations. Few would object to Apple closing the loopholes being exploited by Beeper. Electricity isn’t free. Neither is running a large-scale instant messaging platform.</p>\n\n<h2>The Anti-‘Big Tech’ Brigade</h2>\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, when the Beeper saga was running hot, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1733956234200445130\">Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Green bubble texts are less secure. So why would Apple block a new \napp allowing Android users to chat with iPhone users on iMessage? \nBig Tech executives are protecting profits by squashing \ncompetitors. </p>\n\n<p>Chatting between different platforms should be easy and secure. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s her, not me, who capitalizes “Big Tech” as though it’s an organized cabal of law-breaking public-harming bogeymen, <em>a la</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/15/us/tobacco-chiefs-say-cigarettes-aren-t-addictive.html\">Big Tobacco</a>. Warren’s argument here is that iMessage is superior to SMS (true), and that Apple should not use the superiority of its own bespoke messaging platform as a selling point for its own devices. As though it’s somehow wrong that Tim Cook, the CEO of the company that sells iPhones, suggested to a questioner complaining about SMS limitations at a conference last year, “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23342243/tim-cook-apple-rcs-imessage-android-iphone-compatibility\">Buy your mom an iPhone</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>Keeping an exclusive feature exclusive is not “squashing competitors”. And chatting between different platforms <em>is</em> easy, secure, and free, using apps like WhatsApp and Signal.</p>\n\n<p>A week later came a letter to the Department of Justice, signed by senators Amy Klobuchar (D, Minnesota) and Mike Lee (R, Utah), and representatives Jerry Nadler (D, New York) and Ken Buck (R, Colorado), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jolingkent/status/1736601539790446592\">reported by CBS News’s Jo Ling Kent</a> (also on Twitter/X). From their letter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We write regarding Apple’s potential anticompetitive treatment of \nthe Beeper Mini messaging application. We have long-championed \nincreased competition, innovation, and consumer choice in the \ndigital marketplace. To protect free and open markets, it is \ncritical for the Antitrust Division to be vigilant in enforcing \nour antitrust laws. That is why together we have led efforts in \nCongress to ensure the agency has the authorities, tools, and \nresources necessary to police abuses of market power. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: <em>Apple is very big and powerful so we just assume this is bad.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Earlier this month, Beeper introduced Beeper Mini, an \ninteroperable messaging service that allows users of the Android \nmobile operating system to communicate with users of Apple’s \niMessage service. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wrong. There is only one service at hand, iMessage, and that service is and always has been a proprietary platform created and run by Apple, exclusively for owners of Apple devices such as iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Beeper Mini is an unauthorized client for iMessage, not a service unto itself.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Previously, Android users were unable to securely communicate with \niMessage users and were relegated to using decades-old, \nunencrypted SMS technology. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, it’s as though modern end-to-end encrypted platforms such as WhatsApp and Signal — which are available free of charge on Android, iOS, MacOS, and Windows — don’t even exist, or that Apple was blocking them from the App Store. WhatsApp has over 2.7 billion active users, so it’s not exactly obscure, and these apps are <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/app_store_rankings_as_a_proxy_for_social_network_momentum\">among the most popular on the entire App Store</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Within days of its launch, Beeper Mini users began to \nexperience service disruptions. Apple admitted it took action \nto disable Beeper Mini, citing security and privacy concerns \nfor iMessage users. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is embarrassingly confused, and treats Beeper Mini as a peer to iMessage. But that’s not an apt description. There is only one iMessage — that’s the protocol and platform Apple runs. Beeper Mini users aren’t separate from “iMessage users”; Beeper Mini users <em>became</em> iMessage users. Apple didn’t take down Beeper’s rival network; they blocked access to iMessage from Beeper’s unauthorized client software. This should not be controversial in the least.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple executives have previously admitted the company leverages \niMessage to lock users into Apple’s ecosystem of devices and \nservices. Beeper Mini threatened to reduce this leverage creating \nmore competitive mobile applications market, which in turn a more \ncompetitive mobile device market. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The attention to copy editing in that sentence is indicative of the amount of thought put into the letter as a whole.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Earlier this year the Department of Commerce released a report \ntitled <em>Competition in the Mobile Application Ecosystem</em>, describing \nApple as a “gatekeeper” with a “monopoly position” in its mobile \napp ecosystem. The Department of Commerce observed that “antitrust \nenforcement is essential for ensuring competition in the mobile \napp ecosystem.” These findings are consistent with those of \nnumerous other antitrust enforcers and international competition \nauthorities. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This paragraph would make sense in a world where Apple, say, didn’t allow WhatsApp, Signal, Line, Telegram, and Messenger in the App Store. But the market for messaging apps is incredibly competitive, and Apple’s App Store hosts all of them. These four lawmakers claim to be concerned about anticompetitive behavior, but what’s actually going on is actual competition.</p>\n\n<p>Being really good at competing is not anticompetitive.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2023-12-28\">\n<p>Let’s stretch this analogy further: RCS is like a major renovation and upgrade to the public airport terminal waiting areas. Still not as nice as the Centurion Lounge, but better than the grubby status quo. And you can sort of see how the company that runs an exclusive lounge might not consider it a high priority to help improve the public waiting areas.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2023-12-28\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "

         "content_html" : "\n<p>Jason Snell, in a post from August 2022:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I wanted to do a quick follow-up on my recent post about attaching \nan Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/07/touch-id-on-a-mac-desktop-deconstructed/\">to the underside of my \ndesk</a>, because I’ve now done what I threatened to do at the \nend of that piece: I’ve broken into the keyboard, removed the \nimportant bits, and then reassembled it into a little 3-D printed \ncase that contains just the Touch ID button. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Anyway: It works. But I would really love it if Apple would just \nmake a Magic Trackpad with integrated Touch ID. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My desk setup: MacBook Pro with the lid closed, connected to a Studio Display, with my beloved Apple Extended Keyboard II, a mouse on the left (I’m right-handed for most things but taught myself to mouse left-handed all the way back in college, when I started getting RSI), and a Magic Trackpad on the right.</p>\n\n<p>I’m happier with this setup than I’ve ever been with any Mac I’ve ever used. The downside though is that I don’t have Touch ID, because my MacBook’s lid is closed, and I don’t use Apple’s Magic Keyboard. So on workdays, I tend always to wear my Apple Watch, which gives me a lot of the same advantages as Touch ID: I can log into my sleeping Mac without typing my account password, and I can confirm many actions (like Apple Pay purchases, and moving protected files to the Trash) with a double-click of the side button on my watch.</p>\n\n<p>But whenever I’m wearing one of my other watches, I really miss Touch ID. I don’t miss it enough to go through the DIY project of ripping apart a Magic Keyboard to move the Touch ID sensor into a standalone case, though. So I wish that either (a) Apple would add a Touch ID sensor to the Magic Trackpad; or (b) someone would start selling pre-assembled Touch ID sensors in a nice case, repurposed from Magic Keyboards. It’s a bit of a waste to destroy a Magic Keyboard just to repurpose the Touch ID button, but I’d happily pay for it. And while I wish Apple would add a Touch ID sensor to the Magic Trackpad, I doubt they will — that would sully the minimalist “no buttons” look of the Magic Trackpad, and, for people who use a Magic Trackpad alongside a Magic Keyboard, would give them <em>two</em> Touch ID buttons. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Perhaps a hypothetical Magic Trackpad with Touch ID need not look that different at all. There are Android handsets with fingerprint sensors under the display; Apple could put one under the surface of the trackpad, perhaps with nothing more than a subtle dimple or divot to indicate it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href=\"https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/themagicbutton\">Basic Apple Guy mocked up a standalone Touch ID “Magic Button”</a> back in 2022, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=hz9Ek6fxX48\">Quinn Nelson made a video about making his own</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2022/08/my-touch-id-button-is-fully-deconstructed/\">sixcolors.com/post/2022/08/my-touch-id-button-is-fully…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Chief among the discoveries: \nthe unknown attackers were able to achieve an unprecedented level \nof access by exploiting a vulnerability in an undocumented \nhardware feature that few if anyone outside of Apple and chip \nsuppliers such as ARM Holdings knew of. </p>\n\n<p>“The exploit’s sophistication and the feature’s obscurity suggest \nthe attackers had advanced technical capabilities,” Kaspersky \nresearcher Boris Larin wrote in an email. “Our analysis hasn’t \nrevealed how they became aware of this feature, but we’re \nexploring all possibilities, including accidental disclosure in \npast firmware or source code releases.

But this doesn’t seem like a list over which Apple exerted any editorial control. It’s not an “Our Favorites” list, it’s a “top” list. Apple is not exactly corporate pals with Meta or Google, but those two companies account for fully half of that list.</p>\n\n<p>On today’s list of top free apps on the App Store — across all categories aside from games — Threads is #2 and X is (<em>scrolls, scrolls, scrolls...</em>) #63. TikTok and Instagram are in the top 10 and Facebook’s blue app for the elderly remains at #16. Threads’s placement today is surely buoyed significantly by its launch in the EU, but X is downright buried. Keep in mind that popularity charts like this follow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law\">power curves</a> — #63 is in the long tail.</p>\n\n<p>Over in Google’s <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps\">Play Store’s top free apps list</a> today, Threads is #6, behind Temu, TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Shein. Telegram, Cash App, Snapchat, and Messenger round out the top 10. (Google’s own flagship apps aren’t in that list because they’re all included with Android.) Facebook is #13, Facebook Lite #37, Reddit #39, Discord #43 and Pinterest #48. X is down at #67, right below the renowned “Domino’s Pizza USA” app.<sup id=\"fnr3-2023-12-14\"><a href=\"#fn3-2023-12-14\">3</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>These app stores rankings suggest strongly that Twitter/X is dying, and I think Threads in particular is helping to kill it. Momentum and traction are hard to gain and easy to lose.</p>\n\n<h2>The Others</h2>\n\n<p>It brings me no joy to report this, but unless I scrolled past one, there are no Mastodon clients in the top 200 free apps, even looking specifically within the “social networking” category, on either the App Store or Play Store.<sup id=\"fnr4-2023-12-14\"><a href=\"#fn4-2023-12-14\">4</a></sup> (Twitter/X categorizes itself as “News”, not “Social”, as a sad crutch to place higher in a category with less competition.) Even Bluesky makes these lists (#80 on the App Store; #49 on Play Store). And in what may be an interesting socio-economic demographic data point, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/28/politics/liz-cheney-trump-mccarthy-book/index.html\">Orange Jesus</a>’s Truth Social app is #48 on the Play Store (just ahead of Bluesky), but not in the top 200 on the App Store. (Red hats, green bubbles?)</p>\n\n<p>I enjoy Mastodon, and love <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/ivory/\">Ivory</a>, but Mastodon has seemingly peaked in popularity. It’s a niche for nerds. I think it’s a successful niche for nerds — I still see a stream of interesting content in my feed there, and enjoy thoughtful engagement from readers — but Mastodon has seemingly <em>no</em> mainstream relevance, and I don’t think ever will. Regular people do not want to use social networks without algorithmic feeds, and do not want to use social networks whose basic premise they do not understand.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2023-12-14\">\n<p>Oh man, do I need to write about Temu.

I’ll bet if we could somehow combine all iOS Mastodon clients together, the combined “Mastodon” entity would make the list. But still, the fact that none, including the completely free official Mastodon client, make the list at all is a strong signal that the platform has peaked.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr4-2023-12-14\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 4 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "

Here’s the \nrundown: </p>\n\n<p>Apple ID password change: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>If you do nothing</em>: A thief can use the passcode to change \nyour Apple account password and lock you out. This move is the \nkey to thieves turning off Find My and wiping phones for resale. \nSince you, the iPhone’s owner, don’t have the changed Apple ID \npassword, you can’t immediately locate your iPhone or remotely \nwipe its data. </p></li>\n<li><p><em>With Stolen Device Protection</em>: If you want to change an Apple \nID password when away from a familiar location, the device will \nrequire your Face ID or Touch ID. It will then implement an \nhour-long delay before you can perform the action. After that hour \nhas passed, you will have to reconfirm with another Face ID or \nTouch ID scan. Only then can the password be changed. </p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This sounds like a very thoughtful solution to a devilishly tricky problem: a combination of biometrics and a time delay, with exceptions for when you’re in a known location like work or home.</p>\n\n<p>Stern and Nguyen reported a series of stories this year detailing how thieves — in some cases, organized crime rings — were taking advantage of the god-like powers of your device passcode, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-iphone-security-theft-passcode-data-privacya-basic-iphone-feature-helps-criminals-steal-your-digital-life-cbf14b1a?mod=article_inline\">the first in February</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-iphone-setting-thieves-use-to-lock-you-out-of-your-apple-account-716d350d?mod=article_inline\">the follow-up in April</a>. The gist of it is that your device passcode/passphrase controls the keys to your entire digital kingdom. With the phone <em>and</em> your passcode, you can reset your iCloud account password <em>and</em> access the passwords saved in your keychain. Thieves were scamming people to glean their passcodes, then stealing their phones. This granted thieves access not just to the phones’ contents, but to the victims’ banking accounts. And resetting the victims’ iCloud passwords prevented the victims from remotely wiping, locking, or finding the stolen devices. (One way the scam would run: Chat up the victim in a bar, and offer to use the target’s phone to snap a photo of the victim and their friends. Surreptitiously <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2022/06/require_a_passcode_to_unlock_your_iphone\">lock the phone out of Face ID</a> when handing it back to the victim. Then, when next the victim wants to do anything on their phone, they need to enter their passcode. Either the thief or a partner in a team gleans the passcode. Then they steal the phone, knowing the device passcode.)</p>\n\n<p>After Stern and Nguyen broke this story, a lot of people reasonably wondered why Apple allows you to reset your iCloud account password using only your device passcode. The reason is customer support: every single day, hundreds — maybe thousands? — of people are locked out of their iCloud account because they can’t remember the password. Android phones work the same way: you can reset your Google account password knowing only your device passcode. However many people are falling victim to thieves taking advantage of this, there are orders of magnitude more innocent users who <em>do</em> know their phone passcode, but have forgotten their iCloud/Google account password.</p>\n\n<p>Stolen Device Protection addresses the problem well, with balance between security and convenience. No existing workaround is a true defense against a thief who knows your device passcode. (Locking your iPhone with Screen Time protections was suggested by many as a mitigation, but you can completely override Screen Time protections with the device passcode — it just adds a few extra steps.)</p>\n\n<p>Stolen Device Protection will be off by default, but users will be prompted about the feature upon restarting after upgrading to 17.3. That’s a reasonable compromise. My only doubts about the feature are the “home” and “work” safe locations, where the hour-long delay is overridden. (You still need to authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, though.) How are these locations determined? I’ve installed the first 17.3 beta on a spare iPhone, and after enabling Stolen Device Protection, I tried changing my iCloud password, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/12/stolen-device-protection-not-home.heic\">but I still need to wait an hour</a>, even though I’m at home. (And this spare iPhone — my iPhone 13 Pro from last year — hasn’t left my house since September.)</p>\n\n<p>Overall, this new feature is clearly a win for security — and a triumph of Joanna Stern and Nicole Nguyen’s investigative reporting.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

         "content_html" : "\n<p>As hinted by their team over the weekend, Beeper is going to play the cat-and-mouse game with Apple. <a href=\"https://blog.beeper.com/p/beeper-mini-is-back\">From cofounders Eric Migicovsky and Brad Murray on the Beeper blog</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We’ve created an updated version of Beeper Mini that fixes an \nissue that caused messages not to be sent or received. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s quite the euphemistic description of the situation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Phone number registration is not working yet. All users must now \nsign in with an Apple ID. Messages will be sent and received via \nyour email address rather than phone number. We’re currently \nworking on a fix for this. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, what remains broken is the implicit creation of an iMessage account based on the cellular phone number of your device. I described this process in broad terms <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/beeper_i_hardly_knew_her#fn1-2023-12-10\">in a footnote on my column yesterday</a>. It’s a magically-invisible-to-the-user process that’s been part of iMessage since it first debuted as an iOS-only feature in iOS 5.<sup id=\"fnr1-2023-12-11\"><a href=\"#fn1-2023-12-11\">1</a></sup> (At the time, “iOS” covered iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.)</p>\n\n<p>The “magic” is that you don’t have to sign up for an account, or create a new username or account identifier. You just send a message from your phone number to another phone number, and if both numbers are registered for iMessage, the message goes over iMessage instead of SMS, <em>even if you don’t have an Apple ID</em>. Beeper had that working last week. Now, Beeper users need to have an Apple ID, and sign into that Apple ID within Beeper. (Beeper should actively encourage users to create and use <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654\" title=\"Apple Support: Sign in to apps with your Apple ID using app-specific passwords\">an app-specific Apple ID password</a> for Beeper.)</p>\n\n<p>I can confirm that today’s update to Beeper Mini in the Play Store restores the ability to use iMessage, if you’re signed into an Apple ID.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We’ve made Beeper free to use. Things have been a bit chaotic, and \nwe’re not comfortable subjecting paying users to this. As soon as \nthings stabilize (we hope they will), we’ll look at turning on \nsubscriptions again. If you want to keep supporting us, feel free \nto leave the subscription on 🙂. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Good on them. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/beeper_i_hardly_knew_her\">Like I wrote</a>, it was irresponsible to charge a subscription fee for a service they can’t guarantee access to.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Beeper Mini launched on Tuesday and rocketed to top 20 of Play \nStore charts. It was an instant hit. From what we can tell, Beeper \nMini was the fastest growing paid Android application launch in \nhistory. In the first 48 hours, it was downloaded by more than \n100,000 people. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Making it free (instead of a $2/month subscription with 7-day free trial) should only help its popularity, but I think it’s an open question how much demand there is for this. iMessage users might wish their Android-owning friends would install it, but are typical Android users interested? If Android SMS users were interested in installing a third-party app to enable better cross-platform messaging, wouldn’t they be suggesting to their iPhone-using friends and family that <em>they</em> be the ones who install WhatsApp or Signal or something?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note: Beeper Cloud’s new Oct 2023 iMessage bridge never used Mac \n      relay servers and still does not today. It uses a similar \n      method to Beeper Mini, but runs on a cloud server. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Beeper Cloud <em>was</em> relying on Mac relay servers prior to October. And I think regardless of whether the relay servers are Macs or Linux boxes, it doesn’t change the fact that it’s a sketchy idea to entrust a relay server with your Apple ID credentials. But I think this recent change to Beeper Cloud means that you can use an app-specific password with that, too, just like with Beeper Mini — you never need to share your main Apple ID password.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many people have asked, ‘why don’t people just use Signal or \nWhatsApp?’. The answer is that Messages App [<em>sic</em>] is the default chat \napp for all iPhone customers. Not only is it the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect\">default</a>, iOS \nmakes it impossible to change the default chat app. In the US, \nwhere the majority of people have iPhones, this means that the \neasiest way to chat is by tapping on your friend’s name in your \ncontact list and hitting the ‘message’ button. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is disingenuous. It is true that Apple does not allow third-party apps to handle anything related to your cellular account. So cellular phone calls only go through the built-in Phone app, and SMS messages only go through the Messages app. Messages isn’t merely the default handler for SMS, it’s the <em>only</em> handler for SMS. But there is no default for “chat”. iPhone users around the world, in countries where messaging is dominated by apps like WhatsApp or <a href=\"https://line.me/en/\">Line</a>, have no problem ignoring Apple’s Messages app. People don’t start new chats in the Contacts app; they just open the messaging app they want to use. That’s the easiest way to chat.</p>\n\n<p>What they’re really arguing here is that Beeper is entitled to piggyback on the work Apple has done to make iMessage texting seamless between iOS and Mac users — and more so, that Beeper is <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/beeper_i_hardly_knew_her#fn3-2023-12-10\">entitled to free use of Apple’s iMessage server and networking infrastructure</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We deeply object to the allegation that Beeper Mini ‘poses \nsignificant risks to user security and privacy’. This is \ncompletely untrue. As we explained above, the opposite is actually \ntrue. Beeper Mini increases the security and privacy of both \nAndroid and iPhone customers. To prove this, we published a \ndetailed <a href=\"https://blog.beeper.com/p/how-beeper-mini-works\">blog post</a> about how the app keeps data secure and \nprivate. Beeper Mini is end-to-end encrypted. The underlying \nconnection method is <a href=\"https://github.com/JJTech0130/pypush#dataplist-and-mac-serial-numbers\">open source</a>, for anyone to review. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple guarantees the security of both the protocol (iMessage) <em>and</em> the client software (Messages). In fact, because Messages only runs on Apple devices, Apple further guarantees the security of the underlying operating system and hardware that Messages (the app) runs on, and that all iMessage messages are sent between. With Beeper Mini in the mix, Apple can only guarantee the protocol and <em>your</em> client software, if you’re using Messages. Is Beeper Mini storing cached message content and attachments securely on device? Is it transmitting privacy-sensitive metadata back to Beeper with analytics or crash logs? (Beeper Mini has a preference, “Share Diagnostics”, that is on by default but can be disabled.) Beeper can (and does!) vouch for the privacy and security of their client app, but Apple can’t. Beeper is correctly arguing that Beeper Mini does not (and cannot) compromise the security of the iMessage protocol, but that doesn’t mean that its existence doesn’t open security concerns for Apple and its users. And <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/beeper_i_hardly_knew_her\">as I wrote yesterday</a>, the existence of an unauthorized client on a supposedly closed platform creates a genuine <em>perception</em> problem for Apple: if Apple can’t control the clients permitted to connect to iMessage, it looks like they’ve lost control of the platform. And to some degree, they <em>have</em> lost control over the iMessage platform.</p>\n\n<p>It’s fun watching this cat-and-mouse game from the sidelines, but if I were Beeper, I wouldn’t want to be playing.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2023-12-11\">\n<p>It’s worth rewatching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrBIgjodpFs\">Scott Forstall’s introduction of iMessage at WWDC 2011</a>. I know Apple is not going back, but man, I do miss live on-stage demos. The interplay between Forstall and Joz was actually funny, and the demo was completely live.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2023-12-11\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "
