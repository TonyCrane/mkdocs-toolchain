# Localizing Your Theme

Display your theme in your preferred language.

---

NOTE:
Theme localization only translates the text elements of the theme itself
(such as "next" and "previous" links), not the actual content of your
documentation. If you wish to create multilingual documentation, you need
to combine theme localization as described here with a third-party
internationalization/localization plugin.

## Installation

For theme localization to work, you must use a theme which supports it and
enable `i18n` (internationalization) support by installing `mkdocs[i18n]`:

```bash
pip install 'mkdocs[i18n]'
```

## Supported locales

In most cases a locale is designated by the [ISO-639-1] (2-letter) abbreviation
for your language. However, a locale may also include a territory (or region or
county) code as well. The language and territory must be separated by an
underscore. For example, some possible locales for English might include `en`,
`en_AU`, `en_GB`, and `en_US`.

For a list of locales supported by the theme you are using, see that theme's
documentation.

- [mkdocs](choosing-your-theme.md#mkdocs-locale)
- [readthedocs](choosing-your-theme.md#readthedocs-locale)

WARNING:
If you configure a language locale which is not yet supported by the theme
that you are using, MkDocs will fall back to the theme's default locale.

## Usage

To specify the locale that MkDocs should use, set the [locale]
parameter of the [theme] configuration option to the appropriate code.

For example, to build the `mkdocs` theme in French you would use the following
in your `mkdocs.yml` configuration file:

```yaml
theme:
  name: mkdocs
  locale: fr
```

## Contributing theme translations

If a theme has not yet been translated into your language, feel free to
contribute a translation using the [Translation Guide].
